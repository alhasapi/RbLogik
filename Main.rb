require "./Evaluator"


# This project requires some upgrading from since 5 years ago
# I was experimenting with the lastest ruby feature and show casing my skills to myself
# Given the list-like structure of the code why not make it evolve to a list-dialiect?
# The core of the project was generate logical tables. Looking back right now it appears almost
# shallow and to be honest useless. However a new path in the tree of knownledge is making its 
# way through me!
# The idea I'm having is to make it to a lisp-like prolog implementation. It'll be an opportunity to
# learn fully logic programming, inference engines, expert systems and so forth.
